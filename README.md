# Meta_React_Native_Capstone
This repository showcases my final capstone project from the Meta React Native Specialization certificate. The project demonstrates my skills and knowledge acquired during the course, presenting the cross-platform mobile version of the Little Lemon Bistro developed in React Native.

## The Objective
These are the main objectives, I also added additional things that weren't required to make the user experience and app better, which are not listed.

- `Design`: Leverage the provided wireframes and design guidelines from Meta to structure and style the app interface.
- `Onboarding Screen`: Make the first screen on the initial app launch the onboarding screen.
- `Navigation and Authentication`: Create a proper navigation flow with authentication.
- `User Profile`: Create a profile screen with editable user information and additional data gathered during onboarding.
- `Data Fetching`: Fetch data from a network for the menu items.
- `Database Initialization`: Initialize the SQLite database by creating the little_lemon db and table.
- `CRUD Operations`: Implement CRUD operations for storing and managing menu items in SQLite.
- `Filtering Data`: Filter the items by category and search query with SQLite.
- `User Interface`: Implement the design fully and make it responsive and compatible for both mobile operating systems.
